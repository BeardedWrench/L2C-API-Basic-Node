# Git Installation


## MACOS

Xcode Command Line Tools:

This is often the simplest method if you don't already have Git installed.

run `git --version`

If Git is not installed, a dialog will appear prompting you to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Click "Install" to proceed. 

If for whatever reason you are not auto-prompted to install xcode command line tools, run the following command: `xcode-select --install`
